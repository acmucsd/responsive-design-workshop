This repository contains files for ACM Hack's workshop on responsive web design in Winter 2024. The files are for an activity to edit a website style code so that it's compatible on all screen sizes in React/Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) if you haven't already and then install the packages for starter code

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
